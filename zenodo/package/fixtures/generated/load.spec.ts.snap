It contains animal tracking data collected for the study <strong>O_ASSEN</strong> using trackers developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, <a href="http://www.uva-bits.nl">http://www.uva-bits.nl</a>). The study was operational from 2018 to 2019. In total 6 individuals of Eurasian oystercatchers (<em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>) have been tagged as a breeding bird in the city of Assen (the Netherlands), mainly to study space use of oystercatchers breeding in urban areas. Data are uploaded from the UvA-BiTS database to Movebank and from there archived on Zenodo (see <a href="https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking">https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking</a>). No new data are expected.</p>
